  CITANZ Job Referral

<h4 align="center">The job listing board and referral process for CITAN Job Referral. </h4>

## Purpose
The aim for such programme is to create a channel that connects our members with more job opportunities. The job referral platform or, the workflow we provided, is based on a completely fair and neutral basis. As CITANZ, we do not provide it as a service that such a result is guaranteed.

## Tools
The job posting and application will be through github issues, and the notification and communication sent throguh CITANZ Slack in dedicated #jobs channel and as well as the Wechat member group.

## Job Posting Process
The job postings are treated equally but in a controlled format and standard. 

In current stage before recruiting agents are introduced, the job posting format is kept as simple as needed. The following sections are required:

* Job title
* Job level
* Company name
* Referral limit*

A link to job description or job description attached

*Referral limit is up to the referrer to set.

A job position should be sorted in the format stated above and create a new issue here.

Then the job will be advertised to our Slack channel #jobs and pinned to the channel, and posted to our member Wechat group, with job referrer’s information. 

## Job Application Process

We do not select applicants’ CVs or promote any applications to a particular job position, neither do we give advice to a submitted CV. CV consultation will be done in another module for our members within CITANZ. The job referral process is between the job referrer and applicants. The referrer will be responsible for initiating the selection by personally communicate to the applicants to make a decision. CITANZ does not hold any liabilities to such decisions.

When a job seeker sees the job posting on Slack channel or Wechat group, he/she can initiate the communication with the job referrer, and can work on CVs to potentially apply for the job. The job referrals are made between the poster and job seekers. Once the referral is made or the job is closed for any reason (e.g. no proper candidates for the role when the application closes), job referrer should notify CITANZ if they could. In the case when referrals are done, the referees’ information (contact information) should be notified to CITANZ. (Update job status in github issues.)

## Job Referral Follow-ups

CITANZ will follow up the job referral at certain time after the job posting is closed. The following information will be collect to improve our services in the future:

* Q: If the applicants get phone calls from the company he or she applied;
* Q: If the applicants reach 1st round of interview (any interview including HR screening);
* Q: If the applicants reach the final round of interview;
* Q: If the applicants receive the offer;

*Notes*: all information will be held in private, no real name will be stored; 

Our programme coordinator will follow up the job status regularly; The first follow-up time is `4 weeks` after a new job posting. If the applicants are not successful after that time, we will revisit 8 weeks after.
