# How it works

## Scope

The aim for this programme in CITANZ is to open a channel that connects our members to the enterprises for more opportunities. The job referral platform or, the workflow we provided, is based on a completely fair and neutral basis. We do not provide it as a service that a result is guaranteed.

## Tools

The job posting and application will be done through email, and the notification and communication will be done using Slack and/or Wechat, in our dedicated job referral channel, e.g. #jobs or the Wechat member group.

## Job Posting Process

The job postings are treated equally but in a controlled format and standard. In current stage before recruiting agents are introduced, the job posting format is kept as simple as needed. The following sections are required:

Job title
Job level
Company name
Referral limit*
A link to job description or job description attached

*Referral limit is up to the referrer to set.

A job position should be sorted in the format stated above and create a new issue here.

Then the job will be advertised to our Slack channel #jobs and pinned to the channel, and posted to our member Wechat group, with job referrer’s information. 

## Job Application Process

We do not select applicants’ CVs or promote any applications to a particular job position, neither do we give advice to a submitted CV. CV consultation will be done in another module for our members within CITANZ. The job referral process is between the job referrer and applicants. The referrer will be responsible for initiating the selection by personally communicate to the applicants to make a decision. CITANZ does not hold any liabilities to such decisions.

When a job seeker sees the job posting on Slack channel or Wechat group, he or she can initiate the communication with the job referrer, and can work on CVs to potentially apply for the job. The job referrals are made between the poster and job seekers. Once the referral is made or the job is closed for any reason (e.g. no proper candidates for the role when the application closes), job referrer should notify CITANZ if they could. In the case when referrals are done, the referees’ information (contact information) should be notified to CITANZ.

## Job Referral Follow-ups

CITANZ will follow up the job referral at certain time after the job posting is closed. The following information is collected:
If the applicants get phone calls from the company he or she applied
If the applicants reach 1st round of interview (any interview including HR screening)
If the applicants reach the final round of interview
If the applicants get an offer

The first follow-up time is 4 weeks after the job posting is closed. If the applicants are not successful after that time, we will revisit 8 weeks after the job posting is closed.
